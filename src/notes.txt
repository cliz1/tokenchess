DLC?

- Archer/Sniper: Bishop that doesn't move to where it captures

- Prawn: a rook that can capture like a pawn (including en passant, in which case it is called en prawnsant)

- Crook

- Elephant (chataranga)

- Hypnotist: can control pieces within its range

- Ferz: One square diagonally

- Giraffe: elongated knight move.[1] 
It can jump four squares vertically and one square horizontally or 
four squares horizontally and one square vertically, 
regardless of intervening pieces; thus, it is a (1,4)-leaper.[1][2]

- Ship: - can move any distance orthogonally. The ship can share a square with an ally piece 
by moving into them or them moving into the Ship. The other piece is then "boarded".
When the ship move you can choose to take the boarded piece with it. 
If you do, use the Ships move. There can only be one boarded piece on a Ship. 
An boarded piece can leave the Ship with its normal jump/move/capture.

- Camel: 2 squares orthogonally followed by 1 square diagonally

- Wizard: Swaps places with any friendly piece. 

- Dragon

- Xianqui General: replaces the king, but now if the game ends in stalemate, you win
    - if the other side also has Xianqui General, the side delivering the stalemate wins

- Cannon: from Xianqui

- Guard: protects the king

- Goblin

- Bomber: plant and defuse bombs. The bomb zone is ranks 4 and 5. once the bomber lands in this zone, a bomb is planted. 
    only one bomb may be planted at a time. If a bomber lands on a square with a bom the bomb is defused.
     Bomber can move 2 squares diagonally or orthogonally

- Ninja (temporary invisibility) OR Ghost (permanent invisibility)


ABSTRACT IDEAS:

- Salt pillar that can't be captured

- A piece that slowly gets stronger every time it is moved. Good for slow, build-up decks

- A piece that moves again every time it captures

- Pieces that can be moved by either side

- Kings have special powers. Ex: If you choose Chinese king, you win on stalemate. 


Inspiration from Thomas Rayner Dawson, the Godfather of Fairy Chess:

- The grasshopper is a fairy chess piece that moves along ranks, files, 
and diagonals (like a queen) but only by hopping over another piece. 
The piece to be hopped may be of either color and any distance away, 
but the grasshopper must land on the square immediately beyond it in the same direction. 
If there is no piece to hop over, it cannot move. 
If the square beyond a piece is occupied by a piece of the opposite color, the grasshopper can capture that piece.

- The nightrider, alternatively spelled knightrider and also known as the knightmare or unicorn 
(though the latter term sometimes refers to the bishop+nightrider compound), 
is a fairy chess piece that can move any number of steps as a knight in the same direction. 
The nightrider is often represented by an altered version of the knight's icon.[1]
 In this article, the nightrider is represented by an inverted knight and notated as N,
  while the knight is abbreviated as S for the German name Springer.
