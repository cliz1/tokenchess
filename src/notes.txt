QUESTIONS: 

1. what is let? 


2. what is const? why is it that const is sometimes like a function, sometimes like a variable despite supposedly staying the same? is it just that the pointer is constant and the value can change? 

3. if you have a useEffect inside a function, when is that block of code called? is each useeffctinside a function called once per function call? 

4. what is unwrap() when called like this? const setup = parseFen(initialFen).unwrap();
(alias) parseFen(fen: string): Result<Setup, FenError>

5. what does the question mark do: chess?.isLegal(move) and here onMove?.(from, to);

6. const ctx = chess.ctx(); what does context do

7. what is useRef? what is useState?

useState creates a piece of state that React watches.
When you update it, the component re-renders.

1. makeSan seems to play the move. check to see if subsequent play move call is returning an error in handleMove()

2. pgn being printed has a header. remove the header

3. pgn is adding a new branch even if the move matches the main line or another branch. example: 1. e4 (1. e4)
