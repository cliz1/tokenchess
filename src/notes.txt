TODO / DEVELOPMENT PATH
---------------------------------------------------

1. Add new pieces: Snare/Wizard/Archer/Picasso

    - debugging edge cases for special pieces
    - new sprites/names/FEN for Knishop and maybe Knook
    - rename anarchychess repo to tokenchess

2. Create a tutorials page with a tutorial for every new piece (and standard pieces)
    - tutorial pages have quotes

3. Create a board editor page
    - button to open an analysis board with the given fen

4. Re use board editor logic to create a "deck building page" with token allotment
    - allow toggling "perspective", which flips the board and mirrors the pieces
    - bug: when placing a piece on top of another, the tokens for removed piece not reallocated
    - rules: pawn/painter/snare can only go on second rank, rest can only go on first 
    - no king in editor, kings permanently on E1

5. create a page for theoretical discussion topics (more in depth than tutorials)

6. begin developement of online multiplayer

---------------------------------------------------

6. Snare: any enemy adjacent orthogonally to the snare cannot move. cannot move backwards or sideways. cannot capture.
    - FEN: S 
    - Value: 2

7. Wizard: Moves up to 2 squares orthogonally and can jump. Can swap places with a friendly piece. Teleport range: 3 squares. Need open lines to swap?
    - FEN: W 
    - Value: 5-7

8. Archer/Sniper: Bishop that can only move one square at a time. 4 Square Bishop Capture Range. Doesn't move to where it captures. Maybe the knight is immune to archer.
    - FEN: 
    - Value:

9. Picasso: Painter that moves like a king. Can only be obtained by promoting a painter. 

KING VARIANTS:

- Flying General: Gives the flying general check from Xianqi, stalemate wins game

- Honorless King: Can capture own pieces

DLC?

- Cook

- Archer/Sniper: Bishop that doesn't move to where it captures

- Prawn: a rook that can capture like a pawn (including en passant, in which case it is called en prawnsant)

- Crook: it looks exactly like a rook, but its actually slightly weaker.

- Elephant (chataranga)

- Hypnotist: can control pieces within its range

- Ferz: One square diagonally

- Giraffe: elongated knight move.[1] 
It can jump four squares vertically and one square horizontally or 
four squares horizontally and one square vertically, 
regardless of intervening pieces; thus, it is a (1,4)-leaper.[1][2]

- Ship: - can move any distance orthogonally. The ship can share a square with an ally piece 
by moving into them or them moving into the Ship. The other piece is then "boarded".
When the ship move you can choose to take the boarded piece with it. 
If you do, use the Ships move. There can only be one boarded piece on a Ship. 
An boarded piece can leave the Ship with its normal jump/move/capture.

- Camel: 2 squares orthogonally followed by 1 square diagonally

- Wizard: Swaps places with any friendly piece. 

- Dragon

- Xianqui General: replaces the king, but now if the game ends in stalemate, you win
    - if the other side also has Xianqui General, the side delivering the stalemate wins

- Cannon: from Xianqui

- Guard: protects the king

- Goblin

- Bomber: plant and defuse bombs. The bomb zone is ranks 4 and 5. once the bomber lands in this zone, a bomb is planted. 
    only one bomb may be planted at a time. If a bomber lands on a square with a bom the bomb is defused.
     Bomber can move 2 squares diagonally or orthogonally

- Ninja (temporary invisibility) OR Ghost (permanent invisibility)


ABSTRACT IDEAS:

- PAINTER has its own special promiton: Picasso/Painter King, moves like a king but PAINTS instead of capturing

- SNARE has its own special promotion: King Snare, moves like a king and snares in 4 directions

- Salt pillar that can't be captured

- A piece that slowly gets stronger every time it is moved. Good for slow, build-up decks

- A piece that moves again every time it captures

- Pieces that can be moved by either side

- Kings have special powers. Ex: If you choose Chinese king, you win on stalemate. 

- Using the "drop" mechanic from bughouse to create "spell cards"


Inspiration from Thomas Rayner Dawson, the Godfather of Fairy Chess:

- The grasshopper is a fairy chess piece that moves along ranks, files, 
and diagonals (like a queen) but only by hopping over another piece. 
The piece to be hopped may be of either color and any distance away, 
but the grasshopper must land on the square immediately beyond it in the same direction. 
If there is no piece to hop over, it cannot move. 
If the square beyond a piece is occupied by a piece of the opposite color, the grasshopper can capture that piece.

- The nightrider, alternatively spelled knightrider and also known as the knightmare or unicorn 
(though the latter term sometimes refers to the bishop+nightrider compound), 
is a fairy chess piece that can move any number of steps as a knight in the same direction. 
The nightrider is often represented by an altered version of the knight's icon.[1]
 In this article, the nightrider is represented by an inverted knight and notated as N,
  while the knight is abbreviated as S for the German name Springer.
